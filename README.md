# RNN_BinaryAddition
This program is to demostrate how RNN can be trained to add two binary integer in Keras.

The network is trained by two 7-bit long binary integer. However, after being trained, the network can add any bit long binary integer. This cannot be done by a feedforward network.  

There are two implementations. Method 2 is much faster than Method 1.
